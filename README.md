   ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Troubleshooting

### OpenSSL Error

If you encounter the following error while running the project:

```
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

This is likely due to compatibility issues between Node.js v20 and older versions of Webpack or `react-scripts`. 

#### Fix 1: Set the Legacy OpenSSL Provider

For **Windows Command Prompt**:

```cmd
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm start
```

For **PowerShell**:

```powershell
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
npm start
```

For **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm start
```

#### Fix 2: Downgrade Node.js to v16 or v18

If the issue persists, it’s recommended to downgrade to Node.js v16 or v18:

```bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

### Vulnerability Warnings

Running `npm audit` might show various security vulnerabilities. You can resolve them by running:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

If that doesn’t resolve all issues, use:

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

Be cautious, as this might introduce breaking changes.
